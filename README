### Steps in order to run the tests: 

This works both with ``ganache`` and a private chain setup.

In case you have a private chain setup or ``ganache`` installed make sure to change the 
endpoint inside ``./truffle-config.js`` to match your Ethereum node port.

Install truffle using npm. You can find mode information about that [here](https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation).

Once you have truffle installed and the private chain setup working. Change directory to the project root and run: 
``truffle test``, to make sure the contracts run.

You can also use my private chain setup: [here](https://github.com/CosminNechifor/private-chain-setup).
